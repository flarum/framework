be summarized as this:\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * 1 - compare `data` and `cached`\r\n\t\t * 2 - if they are different, copy `data` to `cached` and update the DOM\r\n\t\t *     based on what the difference is\r\n\t\t * 3 - recursively apply this algorithm for every array and for the\r\n\t\t *     children of every virtual element\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * The `cached` data structure is essentially the same as the previous\r\n\t\t * redraw's `data` data structure, with a few additions:\r\n\t\t * - `cached` always has a property called `nodes`, which is a list of\r\n\t\t *    DOM elements that correspond to the data represented by the\r\n\t\t *    respective virtual element\r\n\t\t * - in order to support attaching `nodes` as a property of `cached`,\r\n\t\t *    `cached` is *always* a non-primitive object, i.e. if the data was\r\n\t\t *    a string, then cached is a String instance. If data was `null` or\r\n\t\t *    `undefined`, cached is `new String(\"\")`\r\n\t\t * - `cached also has a `configContext` property, which is the state\r\n\t\t *    storage object exposed by config(element, isInitialized, context)\r\n\t\t * - when `cached` is an Object, it represents a virtual element; when\r\n\t\t *    it's an Array, it represents a list of elements; when it's a\r\n\t\t *    String, Number or Boolean, it represents a text node\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * `parentElement` is a DOM element used for W3C DOM API calls\r\n\t\t * `parentTag` is only used for handling a corner case for textarea\r\n\t\t * values\r\n\t\t * `parentCache` is used to remove nodes in some multi-node cases\r\n\t\t * `parentIndex` and `index` are used to figure out the offset of nodes.\r\n\t\t * They're artifacts from before arrays started being flattened and are\r\n\t\t * likely refactorable\r\n\t\t * `data` and `cached` are, respectively, the new and old nodes being\r\n\t\t * diffed\r\n\t\t * `shouldReattach` is a flag indicating whether a parent node was\r\n\t\t * recreated (if so, and if this node is reused, then this node must\r\n\t\t * reattach itself to the new parent)\r\n\t\t * `editable` is a flag that indicates whether an ancestor is\r\n\t\t * contenteditable\r\n\t\t * `namespace` indicates the closest HTML namespace as it cascades down\r\n\t\t * from an ancestor\r\n\t\t * `configs` is a list of config functions to run after the topmost\r\n\t\t * `build` call finishes running\r\n\t\t *\r\n\t\t * there's logic that relies on the assumption that null and undefined\r\n\t\t * data are equivalent to empty strings\r\n\t\t * - this prevents lifecycle surprises from procedural helpers that mix\r\n\t\t *   implicit and explicit return statements (e.g.\r\n\t\t *   function foo() {if (cond) return m(\"div\")}\r\n\t\t * - it simplifies diffing code\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\tdata = dataToString(data)\r\n\t\tif (data.subtree === \"retain\") return cached\r\n\t\tcached = makeCache(data, cached, index, parentIndex, parentCache)\r\n\r\n\t\tif (isArray(data)) {\r\n\t\t\treturn buildArray(\r\n\t\t\t\tdata,\r\n\t\t\t\tcached,\r\n\t\t\t\tparentElement,\r\n\t\t\t\tindex,\r\n\t\t\t\tparentTag,\r\n\t\t\t\tshouldReattach,\r\n\t\t\t\teditable,\r\n\t\t\t\tnamespace,\r\n\t\t\t\tconfigs)\r\n\t\t} else if (data != null && isObject(data)) {\r\n\t\t\treturn buildObject(\r\n\t\t\t\tdata,\r\n\t\t\t\tcached,\r\n\t\t\t\teditable,\r\n\t\t\t\tparentElement,\r\n\t\t\t\tindex,\r\n\t\t\t\tshouldReattach,\r\n\t\t\t\tnamespace,\r\n\t\t\t\tconfigs)\r\n\t\t} else if (!isFunction(data)) {\r\n\t\t\treturn handleTextNode(\r\n\t\t\t\tcached,\r\n\t\t\t\tdata,\r\n\t\t\t\tindex,\r\n\t\t\t\tparentElement,\r\n\t\t\t\tshouldReattach,\r\n\t\t\t\teditable,\r\n\t\t\t\tparentTag)\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\treturn cached\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfunction sortChanges(a, b) {\r\n\t\treturn a.action - b.action || a.index - b.index\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfunction copyStyleAttrs(node, dataAttr, cachedAttr) {\r\n\t\tif (cachedAttr === dataAttr) {\r\n\t\t\tnode.style = \"\"\r\n\t\t\tcachedAttr = {}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tfor (var rule in dataAttr) {\r\n\t\t\tif (hasOwn.call(dataAttr, rule)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (cachedAttr == null || cachedAttr[rule] !== dataAttr[rule]) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tnode.style[rule] = dataAttr[rule]\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (rule in cachedAttr) {\r\n\t\t\tif (hasOwn.call(cachedAttr, rule)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (!hasOwn.call(dataAttr, rule)) node.style[rule] = \"\"\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvar shouldUseSetAttribute = {\r\n\t\tlist: 1,\r\n\t\tstyle: 1,\r\n\t\tform: 1,\r\n\t\ttype: 1,\r\n\t\twidth: 1,\r\n\t\theight: 1\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfunction setSingleAttr(\r\n\t\tnode,\r\n\t\tattrName,\r\n\t\tdataAttr,\r\n\t\tcachedAttr,\r\n\t\ttag,\r\n\t\tnamespace\r\n\t) {\r\n\t\tif (attrName === \"config\" || attrName === \"key\") {\r\n\t\t\t// `config` isn't a real attribute, so ignore it\r\n\t\t\treturn true\r\n\t\t} else if (isFunction(dataAttr) && attrName.slice(0, 2) === \"on\") {\r\n\t\t\t// hook event handlers to the auto-redrawing system\r\n\t\t\tnode[attrName] = autoredraw(dataAttr, node)\r\n\t\t} else if (attrName === \"style\" && dataAttr != null &&\r\n\t\t\t\tisObject(dataAttr)) {\r\n\t\t\t// handle `style: {...}`\r\n\t\t\tcopyStyleAttrs(node, dataAttr, cachedAttr)\r\n\t\t} else if (namespace != null) {\r\n\t\t\t// handle SVG\r\n\t\t\tif (attrName === \"href\") {\r\n\t\t\t\tnode.setAttributeNS(\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"href\", dataAttr)\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tnode.setAttribute(\r\n\t\t\t\t\tattrName === \"className\" ?
