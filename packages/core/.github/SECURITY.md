# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**We only patch security vulnerabilities in the latest major release (1.x).**

We use [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) for security issues that affect our project. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please disclose it via [this form](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https://github.com/flarum/core).

This will enable us to **review** the vulnerability, **fix** it promptly, and **reward** you for your efforts.

If you have any questions about the process, feel free to reach out to security@huntr.dev or security@flarum.org.
