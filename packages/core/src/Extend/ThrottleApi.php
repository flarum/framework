     * The callable can be a closure or invokable class, and should accept:
     *   - $request: The current `\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface` request object.
     *               `\Flarum\Http\RequestUtil::getActor($request)` can be used to get the current user.
     *               `$request->getAttribute('routeName')` can be used to get the current route.
     * Please note that every throttler runs by default on every route.
     * If you only want to throttle certain routes, you'll need to check for that inside your logic.
     *
     * The callable should return one of:
     *   - `false`: This marks the request as NOT to be throttled. It overrides all other throttlers
     *   - `true`: This marks the request as to be throttled.
     *  All other outputs will be ignored.
