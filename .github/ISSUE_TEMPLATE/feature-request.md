about: "If you have a suggestion please head over to our forum!"

---

We primarily use GitHub as a bug tracker and issue tracker for items we are sure to tackle in the near future. For feature requests, ideas and feedback please post in the Flarum Community: https://discuss.flarum.org/t/proposals. Feature requests are added to GitHub only when they have been accepted by the development team and implementation details have been laid out.
