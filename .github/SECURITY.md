# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During the beta phase, we will only patch security vulnerabilities in the latest beta release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within Flarum, please send an email to security@flarum.org so we can address it promptly.

We will get back to you as time allows.
Discussions may commence internally, so you may not hear back immediately.
When reporting a vulnerability, please provide your GitHub username (if available), so that we can invite you to collaborate on a [security advisory on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories).
